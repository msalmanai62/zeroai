# Zeroai: Ai Driven Text Services

We developed a web application named ZeroAI. Users can input text into the application, which 
then predicts whether it was generated by a human or an AI model. The outcome includes a 
confidence score indicating the model's certainty.
And there is a services page, where all five services are mentioned. The user can select a service 
and use it accordingly.These servies are:
- Facebook/bart-large-cnn for Text Summarization
- Googletrans library for language translation
- Facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h for audio/video transcribe
- Speecht5_tts model for text to speech

Note:
- tools: django app includeing text summarization, text to speech, speech to text , language translate functions 
- accounts: django containing authentication system and detecting llm generated text function
- please contact me for trained models. due to large size they can not be uploaded to github
